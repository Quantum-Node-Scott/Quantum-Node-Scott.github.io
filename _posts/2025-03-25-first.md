### My Journey to AI Bootcamp

At the beginning of this year, I found myself reevaluating my career and thinking how to connect my scattered interests and experiences. After much contemplation, I decided to apply for a bootcamp to learn development again. I was filled with doubts about whether I could do well, but I waited eagerly for the start of the program.

I took online courses from Fast Campus to prepare, revisiting math and Python. 

On the much-anticipated orientation day, we were introduced to the curriculum, daily tasks, and how to make the most of the classes. 

I met the people I'd be learning with, forming small groups where we shared our diverse backgrounds and goals, imagining how we'd spend the next seven months together.

I've taken my first steps as an AI developer with enthusiasm. 🌟
