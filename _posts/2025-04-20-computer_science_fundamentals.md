# Data Structures
## 💡 Why Data Structures Matter in AI?

Efficient **data storage** and **retrieval** is vital for AI. Choosing the right data structure helps:

- Speed up processing time.
- Reduce memory usage.
- Enable effective problem-solving.

Let’s dive into how various data structures help achieve efficient and effective AI coding, along with practical Python examples.

---

## 🧱 1. Data Structures & Complexity: What Are They?

### 📌 Data Structure Basics
Data structures are ways to store, organize, and manage data for efficient access and modification.

**Key concepts:**
- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs):** Logical structure without specifying exact implementation.
- **Concrete Implementations:** Actual implementation using a specific language (like Python).

---

### 📌 Understanding Complexity (Big-O notation)

- **Time Complexity:** How processing time grows with input size.
- **Space Complexity:** How memory use grows with input size.

```python
# Example: measuring time complexity (O(n) vs O(1))

import time

# O(n) example
start = time.time()
result = 0
for i in range(1, 1000000):
    result += i
print(f"O(n) loop took: {time.time() - start:.5f} seconds")

# O(1) example
start = time.time()
result = (1000000 * (1000000 + 1)) // 2
print(f"O(1) calculation took: {time.time() - start:.5f} seconds")

```
---

## 📚 2. Core Python Data Structures: Lists, Dicts, and Sets

### 📌 List [ ]: Ordered & Mutable
	•	Strength: Fast indexing (O(1)), sequential access.
	•	Weakness: Slow searching/insertion/deletion in the middle (O(n)).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")
print(fruits[1])  # banana
```

### 📌 Dictionary { }: Key-Value pairs
	•	Strength: Fast key-based lookups (O(1) on average).
	•	Weakness: Memory usage.

```python
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(user["name"])  # Alice
```

### 📌 Set { }: Unordered & Unique
	•	Strength: Fast membership testing (O(1)).
	•	Weakness: No ordering or indexing.

```python
unique_fruits = {"apple", "banana", "apple"}
print(unique_fruits)  # {'banana', 'apple'}

```
---

## 🧑‍💻 3. Data Structures in Practice: NumPy & Pandas

### AI frequently uses specialized libraries:

### 📌 NumPy: Numerical Operations

Efficient numerical computation for large arrays.

```python

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr * 2)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### 📌 Pandas: Structured Data Manipulation

DataFrame structure for easy handling of structured data.

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {"name": ["Alice", "Bob"], "age": [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df[df["age"] > 25])
```

---


## 🚀 4. Advanced Python Data Structures: Collections & Heapq

### 📌 Collections Module

Enhanced data structures like Counter, deque, defaultdict.

```python
from collections import Counter

cnt = Counter(["apple", "banana", "apple"])
print(cnt)  # Counter({'apple': 2, 'banana': 1})
```

### 📌 Heapq Module

Efficiently manages priority queues.

```python
import heapq

heap = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4]
heapq.heapify(heap)
heapq.heappush(heap, 0)
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # 0
```

---

### 🎯 Wrap-Up: Choosing the Right Structure

Selecting the right data structure significantly impacts the performance of AI applications. Remember:

Use-case	Recommended Structure
Fast index access, ordered data	List [ ]
Fast key-value access	Dictionary { }
Unique items, fast lookup	Set { }

Let's explore key algorithms, understand their efficiency, and implement them in Python.

---

## 🔄 1. Algorithm Basics and Efficiency

### 📌 What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem efficiently. It provides clear instructions on what to do and how to do it.

### 📌 Understanding Complexity Again
- **Time Complexity (Big-O)**: Efficiency in terms of execution time.
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage as input size grows.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Core Algorithm Examples

### 📌 Searching Algorithms
Efficiently finding elements in data.

#### **Linear Search** (`O(n)`):
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value == target:
            return i
    return -1

print(linear_search([1,2,3,4,5], 4))  # Output: 3

Binary Search (O(log n)):

def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

print(binary_search([1,2,3,4,5], 4))  # Output: 3
```
---

### 📌 Sorting Algorithms

Organizing data systematically.
```python
Bubble Sort (O(n²)):

def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

data = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22]
bubble_sort(data)
print(data)  # Output: [12, 22, 25, 34, 64]

Quick Sort (O(n log n)):

def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

data = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22]
print(quick_sort(data))  # Output: [12, 22, 25, 34, 64]

```

```python
def gradient_descent(x, y, lr=0.01, epochs=100):
    m, b = 0, 0
    n = len(x)
    for _ in range(epochs):
        y_pred = m*x + b
        dm = (-2/n) * sum(x * (y - y_pred))
        db = (-2/n) * sum(y - y_pred)
        m -= lr * dm
        b -= lr * db
    return m, b

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2.2, 2.8, 4.5, 3.7, 5.5])
print(gradient_descent(x, y))

SELECT name, age FROM users;

-- INSERT new data
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 28);

-- UPDATE existing data
UPDATE users SET age = 29 WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- DELETE data
DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (name TEXT, age INTEGER)')

# Insert data
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)', ('Alice', 28))
conn.commit()

# Fetch data with pandas
df = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM users', conn)
print(df)

conn.close()
```
