# AI Bootcamp Mindset Lecture

**Hello again**, this is my second AI blog post.

## 🧠 The Origins of AI: Alan Turing & The Imitation Game

AI's roots trace back to **Alan Turing**, a brilliant British mathematician and cryptographer.  
During World War II, he played a crucial role in decoding the German **Enigma** machine — a breakthrough that shortened the war.

In 1950, Turing published a groundbreaking paper, *“Computing Machinery and Intelligence,”* where he asked a powerful question:

> **"Can machines think?"**

To explore this, he proposed the **Imitation Game**, now known as the **Turing Test**.

### 🎮 The Imitation Game
- A human communicates with both a machine and another human.
- If the questioner can't reliably distinguish the machine from the human,  
  the machine is said to "think".

This simple idea laid the philosophical and practical foundation of artificial intelligence.

## 💡 Daily Commit, Daily Growth: Insights from Namhyuk Kim (Upstage)

Today’s session was led by **Namhyuk Kim**, a Data Manager at **Upstage**,  
who shared practical and motivating insights into how we should approach this AI journey.

### 🔁 1 Commit a Day: Build Your Habit, Build Your Future

Namhyuk emphasized the importance of **committing to GitHub daily**,  
not just for technical growth but also as a **visible record of discipline and progress**.

> **"One commit a day may seem small, but over time it becomes your greatest asset."**

He also advised us to prepare early and thoroughly for **recruitment**,  
recommending **plenty of coding tests** and **as many interviews as possible**.

## 🚀 My Resolution

Inspired by his words, here is my personal commitment during this bootcamp:

- 🧩 **Grow 1% every single day**  
  Even the smallest progress is progress. I will keep learning and keep showing up.

- 🧪 **Apply to as many companies as I can**  
  I want to evaluate my skills directly in the market and grow through feedback.

- 🛠️ **Sharpen my abilities to contribute in the real world**  
  My ultimate goal is to bring value — not just to myself,  
  but to the **future** where **AI powers every platform**,  
  and **AI integrates deeply into manufacturing and engineering**.
